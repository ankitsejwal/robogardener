Setting Raspberry Pi to waterðŸš° my indoor plants.
Everytime it waters the plant, it posts a tweet from @robogardener twitter handle mentioning me @ankitsejwal.
Using twitter I get notified everytime the plant is watered.

Parts needed:
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (Other Pi's can be used as well)
- Water pump and tubes
- 3 Volt DC relay
- A green indoor plant ðŸ˜Š
- (Will be adding a moisture sensor soon)
